The People’s Sound
==================

The [People’s Dictionary](http://folkets-lexikon.csc.kth.se/folkets/folkets.en.html), or Folkets lexikon in Swedish, is a comprehensive English–Swedish dictionary maintained by KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology, in Stockholm. Unfortunately, it is very inconvenient to listen to words’ pronunciations in this dictionary: once you click the corresponding little speakerphone, you end up on a new page with a huge speakerphone in the middle which you need to click to listen to the pronunciation. The People’s Sound extension for Google Chrome allows you to do the same but in one click and without leaving the main page of the dictionary. Just hover your mouse over a little speakerphone, click it, and enjoy!

The extension can be installed from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-peoples-sound/jcohdiafegenfeehhcffkgeihpkcilmm).
